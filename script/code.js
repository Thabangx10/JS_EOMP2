// Create an empty array that will be targeted to our checkout page so that everytime a user selects a product, it will automatically update the checkou.html page with that product that you have selected



// Use the same technique to parse a object into a container, that we used in our 'admin.js'




//  Set your items object array to localStorage


// Create a container that will hold the targeted element



// Create a function that will also iterate through the object array and display each property within object array and display them in our targeted element



// We are now going to create and a function to sort our property based on filtered length on our object array.



// Implement logic for our buttons using functions whilst also creating a checkout button function
